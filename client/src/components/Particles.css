/* If we want the container to capture mouse events for the effect, 
   we might need to adjust pointer-events, but usually we want to edit text 
   on top of it. The current implementation attaches mousemove to the 
   container, so we need pointer-events: auto if it's on top, or 
   ensure the editor is on top but background is behind.
   
   Strategy: 
   - Particles at z-index 0
   - Editor/Content at z-index 1
   - To get mouse movement, we can attach listener to window or a wrapper 
     that encompasses both.
