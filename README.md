# NoteX 📝✨

**NoteX** is an open and collaborative notes platform designed for everyone 🌍.

With a focus on simplicity and teamwork 🤝, NoteX allows users to write notes 🗒️, track tasks ✅, and collaborate in real time ⚡. The platform encourages idea sharing 💡 and transparent workflows 🔍, making it ideal for personal productivity 👤 as well as team collaboration 👥.

At its core, NoteX stands for **Notes Open To Everyone, eXchange** 🔄 — a space where ideas flow freely 🌊 and work gets done together 🚀.

## 🚀 Why Notex?

We built Notex on the principle of **Zero-Friction Collaboration**.

- **Speed First 🏎️**: Create a room and start typing in seconds. No sign-ups, no onboarding wizard, no nonsense.
- **Human-Friendly URLs 🎯**: Share memorable room links like `notex.pranavdhawale.in/my-project` or `notex.pranavdhawale.in/cosmic-whale`.
- **Real-Time Magic ✨**: See cursors fly and text appear instantly with CRDT-backed concurrency.
- **Ephemeral & Private 🔐**: Rooms auto-expire (24h empty, 7d with content) but you can save snapshots when needed.
- **Mobile-First �**: Designed for seamless use on phones with a dedicated mobile UI and files modal.
- **Engineering Excellence 🛠️**: A simple UI powers a robust, high-performance engine utilizing Go and modern web technologies.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Want to see it in action? You only need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pranavdhawale/notex.git
cd notex

# Start development environment 🚀
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

That's it!

- 🎨 **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- ⚙️ **Backend**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- 🍃 **MongoDB**: `mongodb://localhost:27017`

## 🏗️ Architecture

NoteX follows a **Client-Server** architecture with real-time WebSocket communication.

```

### Key Components

- **Client**: React SPA with Tiptap editor and Yjs integration
- **Server**: Go API server with WebSocket hub, secured by centralized rate limiters and auth middleware
- **MongoDB**: Persistent storage for rooms, content, and metadata
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible service for robust, scalable object & file storage
- **WebSocket Hub**: Manages active connections and broadcasts updates
- **Smart Cache**: Browser-based caching for resilience

## 👩‍💻 Development

We use a modern dockerized workflow with hot-reloading for both backend and frontend.

### Commands

```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Rebuild containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build

# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f

# View specific service logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f server
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f client
```

### Development Features

- **Hot Reload**: Both client (Vite) and server (Air) support live reloading
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety on the frontend
- **Go Modules**: Dependency management with go.mod
- **Docker Volumes**: Code changes reflected immediately

## 🎯 Room Slug Examples
